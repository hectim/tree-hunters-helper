Evil trees spawn randomly on members worlds.
People go and scout the world and know when that one is expected to spawn.
This is just a tool to keep track of scouted worlds.

*Usage*:
* Clicking a world will show a slider.
  - Clicking and dragging will set that world to spawn in that number of minutes.
* Clicking the up or down arrow in the top corners will jump to the top or bottom of the page.
* Clicking the title will hide all non-activated worlds (the ones without time)

More features to come if I ever get any users.
